# A basic snake in python3
The first you see in this directory is the very first and most basic implementation of snake. 
The `snake.py` is a very basic implementation and functionally written with no wall collision nor snake collision, which means you can play<br>
forever if wished. <br>
The `Snake.py` is a bit further implemented and holds collisions and a pointsystem. As you die in the game you submit your score to the <br>
Highscore list which is shown within the terminal.<br>

## Snake V.2.0
This is where I'm currently am developing this project, this is an object orientated implementation and <br>
will hold an implementation to be able to have an AI use the input and be able to create AI algorithms to <br>
manouver the snake.
